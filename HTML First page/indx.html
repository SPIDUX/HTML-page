        Hello and welcome to this site under construction. My name is Spidux,
        and I am from Kenya—one of the best countries you'll ever visit, located
        in East Africa.
      </p>
      <h3>My motherland</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Kenya for a safari and experience the best mountain hikes,
        flamingos, and the incredible migration of 1.5 million wildebeest at the
        Serengeti. Enjoy a taste of Kenyan culture, food, and talents, from the
        coast to the Maasai, and across the Great Rift Valley, dotted with
        highland tea farms.
      </p>
      <h3>The Nairobi National Park</h3>
      <p>
        Take tours to various parks, including an exclusive wildlife national
        park located in the capital city—one of its kind in all of Africa.
        Truly, we run the world.
      </p>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am an aspiring front-end to full-stack web developer with a background
        in pharmaceutical technology (trained by the best) and procurement
        (ongoing at one of the best public universities I can afford).
      </p>
      <h3>Talents and Work</h3>
      <p>
        I have a basic foundation in front-end technologies like HTML and CSS,
        and I am continuously learning JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about using web development to create innovative
        solutions for real-world challenges in healthcare and supply chain
         management.
      </p>
      <h3>I'll Let You in on a Secret: My First Love</h3>
      <p>
        Movies have been my first love since I laid eyes on my first one:
        <i>7 Lucky Ninjas</i>, followed by <i>Shaolin Soccer</i> and
        <i>The Mask</i>. I remember the days when I would pay to watch movies at
        a video shop in our small rural town. Back then, we used video
        cassettes—there was no Netflix and chill, and the internet was still
        years away from being a reality.
      </p>
      <h3>The Great Wall of Asia</h3>
      <p>
        Luckily, we owned one of those all-time classic
        <strong>Great Wall TVs</strong> powered by the galaxy, and I would watch
        <i>Sinbad</i> and <i>Walker, Texas Ranger</i> on Fridays. I also enjoyed
        WWE, where The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) would wrestle against Stone Cold
        Steve Austin—it was so much fun!
      </p>
      <p>
        Movies have remained one of my top sources of entertainment, thanks to
        Hollywood and its great list of actors. Legends like Chuck Norris,
        Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Rambo, and Jean-Claude Van Damme have made a
        lasting impact on me, and the list of great actors keeps growing.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
